# Phys 449 Final Project

Final project for Phys 449 taken during Fall 2021 with Pooya Ronagh.
To begin training, type:



‘’’



Python main.py -json <param.json file> -system_size <N> -results_path <res_directory> -symmetric <Symmetric>







<param.json file> : List of hyperarameters



<N> : Size of system, Number of spins



<res_directory> : Where to save figures 



<Symmetric> : 1 for symmetry imposed, 0 for no symmetry imposed



‘’’



Json file



‘’’



Hyperparameters that can be found and changed:



Learning rate
Epochs
Display Epochs (When verbose = True, will show progress for every integer * display epochs, I.e if Display Epochs = 10, will display metrics every 10 epochs)






Model parameters



Number of hidden units(Integer)






Miscellaneous:



Verbosity (1 or 0 [True or false])






‘’’







utilities.py



‘’’



utilities.py contains Utility functions, I.e:



Support functions for visualizing results
Percentage of samples/data that obeys U(1)-symmetry
Computing fidelity of RNN’s wave function
Loading needed data/constants
Loading observables data such as ground state wave function, and energy difference(for testing fidelity/energy diff)
Loading data generated by DMRG(for training/sampling)


‘’’ 







visualizations.py



‘’’



Plots observables/metrics over epochs for different system sizes both for normal RNN and U(1)-symmetry



Plots:
Loss, energy difference, non-zero Sz, and fidelity for epochs [0,2000]


‘’’







training.py



‘’’



Training function for the RNN



Uses stochastic gradient descent to back propagate the optimal hidden layers to minimize negative loss likelihood


‘’’



main.py



‘’’



Primary entry to rest of code



Loads model hyper parameters and data
Creates directory to store results
Initializes RNN
Begins training
Displays execution time


‘’’







RNN.py



‘’’



Defines the feedforward RNN



Defines the GRU cell and it’s entire process


‘’’
